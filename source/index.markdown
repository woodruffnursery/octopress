Herbs
------
We grow a large variety of herbs (culinary and medicinal) that we sell in pots at various plant fairs throughout the year. We are also happy to post plants. There is list of varieties and prices in our Herbs section.

We also sell a selection of seasonal vegetable plants, soft fruit plants, Asparagus and Artichoke (Globe and Jerusalem) plants 
  

All Organically Produced
------
  - All our herbs and vegetables are propagated and grown here at the nursery. 
  - We always use peat free compost. 
  - Our pots are recycled. 
  - We feed plants with seaweed and comfrey liquid feed.

Thanks, Chris & Angela.
